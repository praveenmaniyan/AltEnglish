# AltEnglish
AltEnglish explores an alternative way of writing English using an engineered, feature-based script designed around speech sounds rather than historical spelling. The repository provides a Python tool that converts standard English words into AltEnglish symbols and produces both traditional and phonetic audio outputs.
